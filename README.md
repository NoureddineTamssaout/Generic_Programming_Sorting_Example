# Generic_Programming_Sorting_Example
This C++ code demonstrates the use of templates, which is a generic programming concept. Templates allow the programmer to write generic code that works with multiple data types.  

The code defines two functions using templates: trierTableau and afficherTableau. trierTableau is a function for sorting an array of any data type using the selection sort algorithm, and afficherTableau is a function for printing the contents of an array.  

The code also defines a class called Sorter, which has two member functions: sortArray and sortWords. sortArray uses the trierTableau and afficherTableau functions to sort an array of any data type and print its contents. sortWords sorts the words in a given string alphabetically using the std::sort function.  

The main function uses an instance of the Sorter class to sort arrays of integers and floats, as well as to sort words in a given string.  

Overall, the code demonstrates the use of templates to write generic functions that can work with different data types, which is a core concept of generic programming.
